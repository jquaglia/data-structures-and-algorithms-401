# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
First-in, First out Animal Shelter

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.

- Implement the following methods:

  - enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.

  - dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- `enqueue` Space: O(1), Time: O(1)

- `dequeue` Space: O(1), Time: O(1)
