- Write unit tests for each method that we define

    1. Expected outcome

    1. Expected Failure

    1. Edge Case

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- To approach this, I went through the whiteboard steps. This gave me plenty of time to talk about possibilities for solutions to this code. After going through the whiteboard steps, the actual code challenge just worked. I also tried a couple random things in repl.it just to see how things were affected.

- The Big O efficiency for this is O(1).
