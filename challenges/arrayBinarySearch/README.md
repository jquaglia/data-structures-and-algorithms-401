# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- We talked about this in our group. We knew we were going to need a while loop. We knew we would need to use similar steps as past challenges to find the midway point in the array. We were able to find great documentation to figure this challenge out.
