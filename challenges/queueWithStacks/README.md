# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement a Queue using two Stacks

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:

  - enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

  - dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

- The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- Enqueue - Space: O(1), Time: O(1)

- Dequeueueueu - Space: O(n^2), Time: O(n^2)
